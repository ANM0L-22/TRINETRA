Problem Description
TRINETRA is an AI-powered intelligent traffic monitoring system designed to improve road safety and traffic management using computer vision and deep learning. The system analyzes real-time CCTV/video feed to detect and classify vehicles such as cars, buses, bikes, and pedestrians, and performs automated vehicle counting for traffic analytics.

It also identifies traffic rule violations like helmet absence, seatbelt non-compliance, wrong-side driving, mobile phone usage while driving, and detects blackened/tampered number plates using OCR-based number plate recognition. TRINETRA generates time-based reports such as vehicle flow in one hour, violation logs, and traffic density status for congestion analysis.

By automating surveillance and reporting, the system reduces manual dependency, increases rule enforcement efficiency, and supports smarter traffic control for smart-city environments.
Objectives
To automatically detect and classify vehicles such as cars, buses, bikes, and pedestrians using AI.

To perform real-time OCR-based number plate recognition and track vehicle movement over time.

To detect traffic violations including:

Helmet violation

Seatbelt violation

Wrong-side driving

Mobile phone usage while driving

Blackened / tampered number plates

To analyze traffic density and identify congestion in real time.

To provide accurate traffic analytics for law enforcement and smart city planning.

To reduce dependency on manual traffic surveillance and improve road safety.
Proposed Solution
The proposed system, TRINETRA, is an AI-driven intelligent traffic monitoring platform that uses computer vision, deep learning, and OCR to analyze real-time traffic footage from CCTV cameras.

The system performs vehicle detection and classification, reads number plates using OCR, and monitors traffic violations such as helmet absence, seatbelt non-usage, wrong-side driving, phone usage, and blackened number plates. It also tracks vehicle movement over time to analyze traffic flow and congestion.

This unified approach enables real-time enforcement, congestion management, and emergency response, making roads safer and traffic systems smarter.
